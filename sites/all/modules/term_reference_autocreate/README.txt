INTRODUCTION
------------

This module provides new field widget for 'Term reference' field type that will
allow users to add new taxonomy terms from the node creation form.

Default 'Autocomplete term widget (tagging)' field widget forces users to add
new terms separated by comma. And it is not very convenient when people need to
create a lot of terms, because they should be placed in one input.

Term Reference autocreate widget gives the ability to create new terms using
"Add another item" button, so new term will be placed in separate input.
It helps users to edit content easily.
